    "# p-value (probability value) in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning leverages statistical models to uncover patterns, make predictions, and guide decisions in large datasets. To assess the performance and reliability of these models, statistical tests are essential. The p-value observe the test resultsby assuming that the null hypothesis (H0) is true. The null hypothesis (H0) is defined as the hypothesis with no statistical significance between two variables \n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value, ranging from 0 to 1, represents the level of significance in statistical tests. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis (H0). If the p-value is very small, it suggests that the observed result is plausible but does not conform to the null hypothesis. A p-value of 0.05 is commonly used as the significance level (α). When p-value > 0.05, the null hypothesis is accepted; when p-value < 0.05, it is rejected, indicating statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![P_Value_1](../SupplementaryDocuments/EigenValueDecomposionImage/p_value1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value plays a crucial role in various aspects of machine learning, including model selection, variable selection, hypothesis testing, and overfitting control. It helps in comparing model performances, identifying significant variables, validating hypotheses, and ensuring that models generalize well to new data. By providing a measure of statistical significance, the p-value aids in making informed decisions throughout the machine learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "P-values are fundamental in hypothesis testing, yet they are susceptible to two types of errors: Type I and Type II. A Type I error occurs when the Null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, with a maximum probability defined by alpha, independent of sample size. A Type II error arises from the incorrect acceptance of the Null hypothesis, with its probability (beta) influenced by both the sample size and alpha. Beta decreases as sample size or the number of tests increases. Understanding these errors is crucial for accurate decision-making in statistical analysis.\n",
